Getting and Cleaning Data - Peer Graded Assignment
--------------------------------------------------

This repo contains submissions for the peer graded assignment for "Getting and Cleaning data" course of the John Hopkins Data Science course, available in coursera.

In addition to this repo, there are four other files in this repo:

* `CodeBook.md`: Comprises brief description of input variables and transformations performed to clean and aggregate the input data
* `run_analysis.R`: R script to programmatically achieve the above. The user may want to change the working directory in the first row of the file.
* `wearablesdata.txt`: Cleaned up dataset (i.e., training and test datasets merged, unwanted columns removed)
* `wearablesdatameans.txt`: Averages of all items by activity description and subject
